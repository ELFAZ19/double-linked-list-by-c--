# 📚 Doubly Linked List Student Management System 🎓

Welcome to the **Doubly Linked List Student Management System**! 🎉 This C++ project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a doubly linked list to manage student records. It allows you to perform various operations such as inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying student data in both forward and backward directions. This project is ideal for learning and understanding how doubly linked lists work in C++. 🖥️

## 🌟 Features

### 1. **Insertion Operations** ➕
   - **Insert at Beginning**: Add a student record at the beginning of the list.
   - **Insert at End**: Add a student record at the end of the list.
   - **Insert After**: Add a student record after a specified position in the list.

### 2. **Deletion Operations** ➖
   - **Delete First**: Remove the first student record from the list.
   - **Delete Last**: Remove the last student record from the list.
   - **Delete After**: Remove a student record after a specified position in the list.

### 3. **Display Operations** 📄
   - **Display Forward**: Display all student records from the beginning to the end.
   - **Display Backward**: Display all student records from the end to the beginning.

### 4. **Search Operation** 🔍
   - **Search by ID**: Search for a student record using their unique ID.

### 5. **Demo Mode** 🎮
   - **Add Demo Students**: Quickly populate the list with 6 pre-defined student records for testing and demonstration purposes.

### 6. **Error Handling** 🛠️
   - The program includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and edge cases.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program uses a **doubly linked list** data structure to manage student records. Each node in the list represents a student and contains the following fields:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the student.
- **Name**: Full name of the student.
- **Age**: Age of the student.
- **Department**: Department the student belongs to.
- **GPA**: Grade Point Average of the student.
- **Prev**: Pointer to the previous node in the list.
- **Next**: Pointer to the next node in the list.

The program provides a **menu-driven interface** for users to interact with the list and perform various operations.
